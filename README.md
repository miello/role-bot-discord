# Role Adding Discord Bot

## Currently in WIP

For personal usage only

## Setup

Before we run bot, we need to install dependency by running this command.

### `pip install -r requirement.txt`

Then add bot `TOKEN_ID` and firebase-admin `CREDENTIAL_PATH` to `.env` (More info about `.env` file in `.env.example`)

### `python main.py`

If we don't want to have a cache, add the tag `-B`
